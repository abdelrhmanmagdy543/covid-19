<h2><big><u>defination of covid-19:-</u></big></h2>
<h3><big>is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8]

    Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12][13] Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]</big></h3>
    <h3><big>Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person.[17][18] Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition (i.e. being coughed on).[17] The risk of infection is highest when people are in close proximity for a long time, but particles can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors in poorly ventilated and crowded spaces.[17][19] In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[17] Touching a contaminated surface or object may lead to infection although this does not contribute substantially to transmission.[17][20] People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.[21][22] People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.[23]

        Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
        
        Preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmissions. Several vaccines have been developed and many countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.
        
        Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.</big></h3>

        <h3><big>During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[24][25][26] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[27][28] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[29] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[30] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov[31] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[32] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[33][34][35] The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[36] Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[37] The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[36]</big></h3>

            Symptoms of COVID-19
            Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[38][39] Common symptoms include headache,[40] loss of smell[41] and taste,[42] nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,[43] diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.[44] People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[44] In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-19.[45]
            
            Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[46] At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[47][48][49][50] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.[50][51][52][53] Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[53]
            
            As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days.[54] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[54][55]
            
            Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</big></h3>

<h2><big><u>Transmission Main article: Transmission of COVID-19:-</u></big></h2>
<h3><big>The virus is transmitted mainly via the respiratory route, when people inhale droplets and particles that infected people release as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze or sing. The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19, but infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors. People are at their peak of infectiousness when their symptoms start, and are infectious for up to 3 days prior to this. Their infectiousness declines after the first week, but they remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they never developed any symptoms.

    The size of the infectious particles is on a continuum, ranging from small airborne particles that remain suspended in the air for long periods, to larger droplets that may remain airborne or fall to the ground. This continuum between droplets and aerosols has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses transmit. The largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, and can be inhaled, or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to cause new infection. The fine aerosol particles are in highest concentration when people are in close proximity, leading to the virus transmitting easier when people are physically close. However, airborne transmission does occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated (such as restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues). In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.
    
    The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; with only 10 to 20% of people responsible for the diseases spread. However, in September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will, as a crude average, infect between two and three other people. This is more infectious than influenza, but less so than measles. It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location. There is a major role of "super-spreading events", where many people are infected by one person.
    
    It is possible that a person might get COVID-19 indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object before touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, though strong evidence suggests this does not contribute substantially to new infections. Although it is considered possible, there is no direct evidence of the virus being transmitted by skin to skin contact. The virus is not known to spread through feces, urine, breast milk, food, wastewater, drinking water, or via animal disease vectors (although some animals can contract the virus from humans).[57] It very rarely transmits from mother to baby during pregnancy.</big></h3>

        <h3><big>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[58] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[59]

            Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[60]
            
            SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[61] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[62][63] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is about 98% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. The structure of the M protein resembles the sugar transporter SemiSWEET.[64]</big></h3>

       <h2><big><u>SARS-CoV-2 variants
        Main article: Variants of SARS-CoV-2:-</u></big></h2> 
        <h3><big>The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[65][66] No standard nomenclature exists.[67] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).[68] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage.[66][69]

            Several notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020.[citation needed] Cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in Denmark.[citation needed] After strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, it is believed to have been eradicated.[medical citation needed]
            
            As of January 2021, three newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 are spreading among global populations, including the UK Variant (referred to as B.1.1.7) first found in London and Kent, a variant discovered in South Africa (referred to as B.1.351), and a variant discovered in Brazil (referred to as P.1).[70]
            
            Using whole genome sequencing, epidemiology and modelling suggest the UK variant VUI-202012/01 (the first variant under investigation in December 2020) in the B.1.1.7 lineage transmits more easily than other strains.[71]</big></h3>
